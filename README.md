Wow only a mere three years later I uploaded my files for my final year project.

Am I doing this as a career now? Absolutely not.

But I did enjoy learning about this (WITHOUT THE HELP OF CHATGPT!!!!!) and I know now you can basically create more with ChatGPT but I was archiving my files and found my project so I thought I'd upload it here.

I have attached my report below so you can kind of get a gist of what it actually is.

I have not retained any information from this project whatsoever, so please do your due dilligence and do your own research :)
